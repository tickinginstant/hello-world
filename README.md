# hello-world

This is a repository that I made in order to try to understand how GitHub works. I've used versioning systems before, but always a little ineptly. So I'm not sure I'm ready for the complications of pull requests, branches, merges, and masters.

Now I'm attempting to edit from my home computer, to see whether GitHub Desktop will work properly.
